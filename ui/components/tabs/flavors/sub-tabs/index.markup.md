Sub Tabs are used to provide an additional level of navigation below the Global Navigation Tab Bar. Use these tabs when users need to work across multiple sub-pages within a single navigation item.

----

The first tab within the Sub Tab Bar is always the default content for the parent navigation item. To differentiate this tab from other sub-navigation tabs, this tab cannot be closed.

When opening a navigation item for the first time, the default sub-navigation tab can be assumed; donâ€™t show the Sub Tab Bar.
When opening the first additional sub-navigation tab a new tab bar is inserted containing both the default tab and the new sub-navigation tab.

All sub tabs are closed when the parent navigation item is closed.

Sub Tabs can optionally include a tab menu for additional controls.
