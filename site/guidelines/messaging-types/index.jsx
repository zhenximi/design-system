      <p>
        At a high-level, we categorize messaging types by the nature of user
        interaction:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li className="slds-m-bottom--x-large">
          <strong>System messaging</strong> alerts the user of important
          system-related issues or status. It&rsquo;s initiated by the system
          and it&rsquo;s not a result of the user&rsquo;s actions.
          <br/>
          e.g. System maintenance coming up this weekend.
        </li>

        <li className="slds-m-bottom--x-large">
          <strong>Engagement messaging</strong> nudges the user to enter or
          update data in the system. It can be initiated by either the system
          or another user.
          <br/>
          e.g. No activity on Opportunity <var>x</var> in the past 30 days.
          Create a task or schedule an event.
        </li>

        <li className="slds-m-bottom--x-large">
          <strong>Access messaging</strong> appears when the user tries to
          access an item that&rsquo;s not available to them. It may be because
          the record has been deleted, the user doesn’t have access, etc.
          etc.
          <br/>
          e.g. Lead <var>x</var> isn’t available.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Feedback messaging</strong> is the application&rsquo;s
          response when the user is interacting with it. The majority of
          create, read, update, delete (CRUD) actions will result in feedback
          messaging.
          <br/>
          e.g. Account <var>x</var> was created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </PageBody>
