        Your custom applications shouldn’t just look and act like the Salesforce
        app – they should sound like it too.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Salesforce, we have guidelines we follow when we create written
        content. We apply the guidelines to text that appears in the app,
        including on-screen instructions and error messages. We use the same
        guidelines for other types of information, such as online help,
        developer doc, Walkthroughs, and Trailhead modules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the Voice & Tone Guidelines to get a quick introduction to our unique voice and tone, and to
        understand how to apply it to your work. The doc provides some quick
        writing guidelines, and includes great examples of the voice and tone
        from the app and the doc.
