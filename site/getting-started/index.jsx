        The Salesforce Lightning Design System includes the resources to
        create user interfaces consistent with the Salesforce Lightning
        principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing
        on pixels, developers can focus on application logic,
        while&nbsp;designers can focus on user experience, interactions,
        and&nbsp;flows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site provides a range of resources for designers and developers,
