- Removed `slds-tile__title`, since it didn't apply any styles

**🗒 Notes About Scoped CSS files, the Unmanaged Package, Visualforce and Lightning Components**

The Lightning Design System CSS is now automatically included for Lightning Components running in the Lightning Experience and Salesforce S1 mobile application (via `app.css`). It is no longer necessary to add a static resource for Lightning Components running within these environments.

Starting in 2.0.x, the Lightning Design System is no longer available as an unmanaged package. Also, the scoped CSS files (`salesforce-lightning-design-system-vf.css` and `salesforce-lightning-design-system-ltng.css`) are no longer distributed as part of the Design System zip file (available in the [Downloads](/downloads/) page). As an alternative, you may now generate your own scoped Design System zip file using the new [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer) and upload it as a static resource as documented on the tool’s page. However, we strongly recommend that you do not install SLDS as a static resource when building for Lightning.

Resources:

- [CSS Scoping Tool](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer)
- [Using SLDS in Lightning](/platforms/lightning/)
- [Using SLDS in Visualforce](/platforms/visualforce/)

## Release [1.0.5] - May 26, 2016

- Adding a background color to icons from the [custom set](/icons/#custom) is now done using the `slds-icon-custom-customXX` class (e.g. `slds-icon-custom-custom25`), instead of `slds-icon-custom-XX` (deprecated). This change addresses [#203](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/203)
- Improved accessibility of the [breadcrumbs component](/components/breadcrumbs/)
- The Design System now allows developers to load Salesforce webfonts using their preferred method instead of the default `@font-face` rules. To disable the default font loading method, set `$slds-load-webfonts: false;` before importing the Design System Sass file.
- The project is now compatible with Node.js 6
- Search! You can now get faster to components and the deepest parts of the documentation using the search field at the top of the navigation

## Release [1.0.4] - May 18, 2016

- Added `title` attributes to icon containers, noticeably improving accessibility for users of pointing devices such as mice and trackpads
- Improved the structure of the [icon component](/components/icons) section, making it easier for you to discover how to decorate your Lightning apps with our beautiful icons
- Fixed the standard call icon, which gets its fancy yellow background back, instead of a purple one that had been assigned to it for obscure reasons (we’ve put our best designers on the case!)
- Fixed [an issue](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/208) where `npm install` would fail on Windows - which is only fair to our developer friends who are on PCs

## Release [1.0.3] - April 26, 2016

- Fixed Sass build issue for npm module

## Release [1.0.2] - April 8, 2016

- Added a link to an [archive of v1.0.0](https://design-system-v-1-0-0.herokuapp.com/), so you can access the documentation and downloads for that previous version
- Generated the unmanaged package for the 1.0.2 patch release
- Fixed the application's version number in the Sass configuration

## Release [1.0.1] - April 8, 2016

Happy birthday! The Lightning Design System turns 1...

**CHANGES**

- Form element breakpoints now fire at small breakpoint rather than large breakpoint - Fixes [design-system/162](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/162)
- Fixed a bug in the Tree component that occurred in the scoped version of SLDS and prevented nested branches from being properly indented  - Fixes [design-system/issues/91](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/91) and [design-system/issues/164](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/164)
- Fixed the file naming structure so that standard Sass implementations can watch the entire project and compile the framework correct files on the fly.
- Fixed a bug where compilation would fail when using Ruby Sass - Fixes [design-system/issues/173](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues/173)
